Nothing is quite as it seems as you surrender yourself to the dazzling sights and soothing sounds of the Neon Dreams Cinema Club, a monthly film series exclusive to The Royal Cinema bringing you the best in delightfully surreal neo-noir cinema from the 70's, 80's, and beyond.Pre-show starts at 7:00pmFeature starts at 8:00pmVISIT THE EVENT PAGE&gt;&gt;HERE&lt;&lt;This 35mm presentation is made possible thanks to our lovely sponsor Sonic Boom and will be preceded by a mind-shattering pre-show, featuring a themed video mixtape of music, film, and television to put you in the right mood. As always this will be a lisenced event, courtesy of Monarch Tavern, and there will be AMAZING PRIZES given out to many lucky patrons. Be sure to arrive early!======After Junior (Alec Baldwin) is released from prison, he plans on starting a new life in Miami. But when he kills a man in the airport, he flees the scene and finds Susie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a mild-mannered prostitute searching for stability. The two opposites become romantically involved, and Junior steals a badge and gun from a veteran detective (Fred Ward). Using the officer's identity, Junior embarks on a crime spree and convinces Susie that he is the perfect man.\"George Armitage's Miami Blues is another film slightly ahead of its time. In 1990 its combination of tough, funny noir and flashes of shocking violence seemed to bemuse audiences. Only five years later would Tarantino turn what was once for cult appreciation only into a global smasheroo. This very entertaining Miami lowlife romp has at its heart two great badass performances, the grizzled Fred Ward as Hoke Mosely and the frequently shirtless and impressively hairy Alec Baldwin as the charming psychopath Junior. This film is a little gem of broken fingers, lost digits and missing teeth. Anyone who has seen my amateur film Dead Right will know that I stole a joke from Miami Blues.\"- Edgar Wright (director of Shaun Of The Dead, Scott Pilgrim Vs.

Krawl Food & Culture Tour","type":"event","id":"LvZ184Ii6JrzSXDEuZZcN","test":false,"description":"Explore the diverse tastes and flavours of Toronto's most eclectic neighbourhoodKensington Market emerged during the early 1900’s, when Jewish immigrants settled in the neighbourhood. Many of the residents began selling their goods and wares from pushcarts and horse-drawn carriages. Within the boundary of a few square blocks located west of Spadina, a bustling area with narrow streets of residential complexes comprising of small stores and colourful awnings was formed to create an open-air market. Throughout the decades, the market gradually evolved and transformed as each new successive waves of immigrants – European Jews, Italians, Portuguese, Chinese, Jamaican – left their mark on the community and added another layer of cultural diversity.For our “Kensington Krawl” food tour, you will have the opportunity to enjoy select tastings in the market including from a cheese shop, bakery, delicatessen, butcher shop, spice shop, and more. You will meet with local merchants and shopkeepers whenever possible during your excursion. Your guide will offer you a background on the history and heritage of this vibrant neighbourhood, with memorable stories and anecdotes. You will discover why Kensington Market is truly a one-of-a-kind place!\nStart Time: 11:30 am.\nDuration: Approximately 3.5 hours.\nCapacity: Up to 12 guests.\nPhysical Demands: Walking at a leisurely pace - total distance is approx. 1.3 km, standing room only for most stops.\nWeather Impact: Tour takes place rain or shine (tour will be adjusted to the weather).\nFood: 6 generous tastings are done within Kensington Market including from a cheese shop, delicatessen, butcher shop, spice shop, sweet shop, and other food establishments.\nDietary Substitutions: Vegetarian and a non-alcoholic option are available.

Charlie Brown takes Lucy's advice and embarks on a series of new activities to gain the interest of the Little Red-Haired Girl, but with his ever present lack of confidence, has trouble making an impression on her, but he keeps trying anyway (we've all been there, Charlie Brown).
